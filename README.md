Ensure the config file is setup correctly before 

==============================
How do I use the setup script?
==============================

Here is how to do it for option...

1 - Your server must be on your C drive to work correctly. Find where is it located on the C drive. (Such as C:\WoW Server). 
    Inside there should be a few folders: '_server' , 'Core' and 'Extras' . If you see those folders you are in the right place. 
    Copy that folders path then right click on the setup script and click enter.

2 - Your game client can be on any drive and due to windows limitations we cannot determine ourselves what drive its in. The drive 
    letter is the first two letters of a folder path. So, your C drive would be C: or your D drive would be D: and so on. Enter this value
    into the setup script and click enter to carry on.

3 - Finding the folder your game client is in is much like finding the folder path of your server! Navigate to the folder where you can find
    'Wow.exe' . Copy that folder path and right click the setup script. Then press enter. For instance if your drive letter was 'C:' you path
    could be C:\WoW Game or if your drive letter was 'D:' your path may be D:\Games\WoW Game
