Version 4.0 Public - WoW WOLTK Server Management Utility

This version focused on completing all features currently possible! This was finished on 16.08.25 at 2:12AM. Supports Trinity AC-Repack WoW Wotlk Server! For more infomation regarding TrinityCore setup please visit https://www.trinitycore.org/ As of the first release there is currently a few features missing! The setup script may not apply your drive letter config right. In that case you just need to navigate into the Logic folder, open the config.txt file and put the drive letter for the drive your client is located on (C:,D:,E:,F:) next to where it says 'CLIENTMOUNTPOINT='

## How do I use the setup script?


Here is how to do it for option...

1 - Your server must be on your C drive to work correctly. Find where is it located on the C drive. (Such as C:\WoW Server). 
    Inside there should be a few folders: '_server' , 'Core' and 'Extras' . If you see those folders you are in the right place. 
    Copy that folders path then right click on the setup script and click enter.

2 - Your game client can be on any drive and due to windows limitations we cannot determine ourselves what drive its in. The drive 
    letter is the first two letters of a folder path. So, your C drive would be C: or your D drive would be D: and so on. Enter this value
    into the setup script and click enter to carry on.

3 - Finding the folder your game client is in is much like finding the folder path of your server! Navigate to the folder where you can find
    'Wow.exe' . Copy that folder path and right click the setup script. Then press enter. For instance if your drive letter was 'C:' you path
    could be C:\WoW Game or if your drive letter was 'D:' your path may be D:\Games\WoW Game
